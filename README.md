Project title: Disability Employment Statistic Analyzer in USA.

Project description:
The project aims to analyze the current employment statistics of people with disabilities in the United States. The project will use pandas to load and manipulate a dataset from the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS). This dataset contains information about people with disabilities in the labor force, such as their age, gender, educational attainment, and employment status.

The project will involve the following tasks
Load the dataset using pandas and explore its contents 
Clean the data by removing any invalid or missing values, and standardize the data types 
Calculate the percentage of people with disabilities in the labor force, and to compare to the general population
Analyze the employment rates and earnings of people with disabilities by gender,age, educational attainment, and industry 
Create visualizations using matplotlib or seaborn to display the analyze data 

Technical Framework: Project will utilize the following technical framework:
Python programming language
Pandas library or data manipulation and analysis 
Matplotlib or Seaborn library for data visualization 

Expected Outcome:
The outcome of this project will be a detailed analysis of the current employment statistics of people with disabilities in the United States. 
This analysis can provide insights to policymakers, employers , and disability advocates on the current state of disability employment and potential areas for improvement

Code Building Outline:
Import libraries: Such as Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis
Load the dataset: Using pandas to read in the dataset containing disability employment statistics 
Cleaning the data: Removing any missing or invalid values 
Explore the data: Using pandas to explore the dataset by analyzing the different variables, such as disability types, age, gender, and employment status. 
Visualize the data: Create visualizations, such as bar charts and pie charts, to help understand the data and identify any trends or patterns 
Analyze the data: Using pandas to calculate various statistics, such as mean, median, and standard deviation, to gain insights into employment rates of people with disabilities 
Create a dashboard : Using python libraries such as Dash or Flask to create an interactive dashboard that allows users to explore the data and visualize the statistics. 
Add user authentication: For security reasons 
Deploy the application: Once the dashboard complete , deploy the application on a cloud platform such as heroku or AWS to make it accessible to others
